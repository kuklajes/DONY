Since then, Elias has been posting photos of some of the dogs he encounters daily around New York City. Over the past two years the blog has picked up a significantly large audience. With its primary social media outlet being Instagram, The Dogist has about 1.6 million followers today. \r\n\r\nThis is what a typical Instagram post looks like:\r\n\r\n![Typical Instagram Post](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16294386/11794984/32dc25e2-a282-11e5-803e-6eba2af0239a.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that in the caption the name, breed, and location of where the photo was taken are included. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dogs of New York\r\n*Dogs of New York* is a visualization of some of The Dogistsâ€™ photos. The goal of this project was to answer the following:\r\n\r\n    1. Where are these dogs being photographed?\r\n    2. What kinds of dogs are being photographed?\r\n    3. What can be inferred about the dogs of New York from these visualizations (in terms of breed and location popularity)?\r\n\r\n# Process\r\n \r\nFirst, I narrowed the 2 years worth of posts to 3 months, May, June, and July of 2015 to use for my visualization.\r\nI took all the information from the caption of these photos and made an excel chart with it using Name, Breed, Location, Age, and Notes(likes) as column headings.\r\n\r\nNext, I uploaded the database into Google Maps; thankfully it was able to geocode the locations provided in the photo captions.  \r\n\r\nSetbacks: In order to get the photos to appear with the point, I had to go through every dog and link the image URL to it through Google Maps.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Map\r\n\r\n[The Dogist](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zHEV5kk-5mMk.koIcFyX6QQtM)\r\n\r\n# Graphs\r\n\r\n[Location,Breed,Name x Age,Notes](https://public.tableau.com/profile/publish/Dogs_3/Dogs_July#!/publish-confirm)\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n[The Dogist Blog](http://thedogist.com/)\r\n\r\n[The Dogist Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/thedogist/?hl=en)\r\n\r\n### Made With\r\n\r\nGoogle Maps\r\n\r\nGoogle Earth\r\n\r\nTableau","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
