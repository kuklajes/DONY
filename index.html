<p><a href="http://thedogist.com/">The Dogist</a> was created by <a href="https://about.me/eliaswf">Elias Friedman</a>, a photographer that took to the streets of New York City in 2013. Since then, Elias has been posting photos of some of the dogs he encounters daily around New York City. Over the past two years the blog has picked up a significantly large audience. With its primary social media outlet being Instagram, The Dogist has about 1.6 million followers today. </p>

<p>This is what a typical Instagram post looks like:</p>

<p>You'll notice that in the caption the name, breed, and location of where the photo was taken are included. </p>

<a id="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodology</h3>

<p><em>Dogs of New York</em> is a visualization of some of The Dogistsâ€™ photos. The goal of this project was to answer the following:</p>

<pre><code>1. Where are these dogs being photographed?
2. What kinds of dogs are being photographed?
3. How does the audience interact with these 
   dogs through social media?
</code></pre>

<a id="process" class="anchor" href="#process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Process</h1>

<p>First, I narrowed the 2 years worth of posts to 3 months, May, June, and July of 2015 to use for my visualization.
I took all the information from the caption of these photos and made an excel chart with it using Name, Breed, Location, Age, and Notes(likes) as column headings.</p>

<p>Next, I uploaded the database into Google Maps; thankfully it was able to geocode the locations provided in the photo captions.  </p>

<p>Setbacks: In order to get the photos to appear with the point, I had to go through every dog and link the image URL to it through Google Maps.</p>

<p>The New York Times posted an article about trends seen in breed popularity based on NYC zip code. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/nyregion/new-york-s-top-dog-it-depends-on-the-zip-code.html?_r=0">NYT Top Dogs of NYC</a></p>

<p><em>dogs are cool</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="trends" class="anchor" href="#trends" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trends</h3>

<ul>
<li>Photos of younger dogs tend to have more likes</li>
<li>Photos are usually taken near parks in NYC, where most pets are</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Data from 3 months verses 3 years</li>
<li>Photos are very selective, you can only make very vague
generalizations from the trends</li>
<li>Not all the data is displayed, sometimes information was not
given in the caption, so those photos were omitted</li>
</ul>
